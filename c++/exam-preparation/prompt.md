Develop a program for a computer store that sells items (keyboard - mouse - scanner), and extracts the sales invoice.
Note:

- Each invoice has an automatic number.
- The program supports entering multiple invoices.
- Each invoice is automatically saved in `D:\Invoices` with a unique number.
- When you have finished processing the purchase invoice, a message appears: "If you want to record another invoice, press the letter "p". If you want to exit the program, type exit."
- The program resumes counting when you run it again, starting from the last invoice number without deleting previous invoices.
- Save the last invoice number in a separate file so that counting resumes on the next run.
- Products are entered by the programmer, not the user.
- Using concepts (Create class, object and attribute, Inheritance and Constructors).
